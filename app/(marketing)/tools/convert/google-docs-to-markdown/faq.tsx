    question: "Do you get access to my entire Google Drive?",
    answer:

      "No, we do not use your email for purposes other than sending you a notification once the export is finished. Once the email is sent, we do not store your email address on our servers. The email with the download link contains a short promotional blurb about our full product, but you wonâ€™t hear from us again.",

        Occasionally, we encounter a document that contains content that trips
        up our Markdown converter. If this happens, you will receive an email
        indicating that the export failed. We encourage you to contact us at{" "}

        see if we can figure out the problem.
